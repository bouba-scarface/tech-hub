Yes, I just used the magical keyword / hashtag / buzzword... "DevOps".  
But this article is not about [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) or its technical implementation with [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/DevOps/).

No, today I'll talk about the definition of your rings of validation in your SAAS release process, how it relates to your environments and how important it is to share a common vocabulary across your dev, ops and product teams.

# Back to basics: Deployment Environments

A common release process involves the [DTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,_testing,_acceptance_and_production) pipeline:

![DTAP](/assets/images/DTAP.jpg)

The four letters in DTAP denote the following steps:
* The program is developed on a **Development** system. This development environment might have no testing capabilities.
* Once the developer thinks it is ready, the product is copied to a **Test** environment, to verify it works as expected. This test environment is supposedly standardized and in close alignment with the target environment.
* If the test is successful, the product is copied to an **Acceptance** test environment. During the Acceptance test, the customer will test the product in this environment to verify whether it meets their expectations.
* If the customer accepts the product, it is deployed to a **Production** environment, making it available to all users of the system.

But aside from this rather common and theorical process, let's have a look at how Microsoft manages its release process in real life

# Learn from the best: Microsoft Office 365

As of the time of writing the article, the [Microsoft Office 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=O365) has more than 500 updates planned.  
To manage such pipeline, across multiple technical teams, functional teams, and product groups, Microsoft uses the following approach:

As you can see, there are more than 4 rings of validation. Worse than that, each ring relies on many isolated environments for different purposes (Security tests, load tests...).

# A more comprehensive pipeline

If we delve into the details, we can even have a more complex pipeline of rings, for instance:

|------+--------------+----------------+------------------|
| Ring | Environments | Classification | Primary Audience |
|:----:|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **4** | **production** | 💥 EXTERNAL | Customers |
| **3.5** | **preview** | 💥 EXTERNAL | Customers (Preview) |
| **3** | **staging** | 🔐 PRIVATE | SalesTim (Tech Team) |
| **2** | **uat** | 🔐 PRIVATE | SalesTim (Product Team) |
| **1.5** | **beta** | 💥 EXTERNAL | Partners (SI/ISV) |
| **1** | **dogfood** | 🔐 PRIVATE | SalesTim |
| **0** | **integration** | 🔐 PRIVATE | SalesTim (Tech Team) |

What is exactly the purpose of each ring?

|------+---------|
| Ring | Purpose |
|:----:|---------|
| **4** | Obvious isn't it? |
| **3.5** | preview is designed to help customers prepare for updates, from a technical and change management standpoint |
| **3** | Test automated deployment in a nearly iso-production environment |
| **2** | The product team tests SalesTim to verify whether it meets their expectations |
| **1.5** | Give strategic partners an early look at the features we're currently working on |
| **1** | SalesTim Internal [Dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) |
| **0** | Used solely for completing integrations and functional testing by the tech team. |

For the moment at SalesTim, with the exception of our development environments, we have a fully automated CI/CD Azure Pipelines process for rings 0, 2 and 4:

|------+--------------+-------|
| Ring | Environments | CI/CD |
|:----:|--------------|-------|
| **4** | **production** | ![Production Branch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Production-CD-success.svg?logo=azureDevOps) | 
| **3.5** | **preview** | ![Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Preview-None-red.svg?logo=azureDevOps) |
| **3** | **staging** | ![Staging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Staging-None-red.svg?logo=azureDevOps) |
| **2** | **uat** | ![UAT](https://img.shields.io/badge/UAT-CD-success.svg?logo=azureDevOps) |
| **1.5** | **beta** | ![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Beta-None-red.svg?logo=azureDevOps) |
| **1** | **dogfood** | ![Dogfood](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dogfood-None-red.svg?logo=azureDevOps) |
| **0** | **integration** | ![Integration Branch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Integration-CI/CD-success.svg?logo=azureDevOps)  |
{:.table-dark .table-sm .table-striped}

While the other one (1, 1.5, 3 and 3.5) still requires some manual operations.  

The advantages of such pipeline:
* A clear and common understanding of each ring purpose
* A real isolation between environments
* An enforced security

# To go further

Of course, SalesTim is not Microsoft (At least for the moment 😉), therefore we don't have the same teams, constraints or volumetry...  

But as our platform gains more traction, we'll have to implement CI/CD for the whole validation rings... so stay tuned for another article!
